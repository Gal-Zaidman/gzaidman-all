The errors/problems we see are:

1. No recognized cloud provider platform found in infrastructures.config.openshift.io/cluster.status.platform

This error is all over (2200+ times).
I saw your comment for Oren on https://coreos.slack.com/archives/CNSJG0ZED/p1587293673108300 should we ignore it for now ?
For some reason I remember we had it in the past and you contacted someone on Openshift that fixed it, maybe I'm mistaken.

2. ConfigMap was deleted as no longer required
We can see it here:
https://storage.googleapis.com/origin-ci-test/pr-logs/pull/openshift_release/8937/rehearse-8937-release-openshift-ocp-installer-e2e-ovirt-4.5/2/artifacts/e2e-ovirt/pods/openshift-config-operator_openshift-config-operator-7cdf95ccb4-s8tcv_openshift-config-operator.log

It appeared 22 times not sure if that is a real error or a side effect

3. invariant violation (bug): pod should not transition Running->Pending even when terminated
May 11 08:44:07.755 W ns/e2e-test-prometheus-2f5nc pod/execpodwqcs5 node/ovirt04-6cfkf-worker-0-jhx5h invariant violation (bug): pod should not transition Running->Pending even when terminated

It appeared 293 times, I asked on slack, probably a bug

4. CSI related:

- Lost connection to CSI driver, exiting
May 11 08:46:46.279 E ns/e2e-ephemeral-3319 pod/csi-hostpath-snapshotter-0 node/ovirt04-6cfkf-worker-0-w4qtl container/csi-snapshotter container exited with code 255 (Error): Lost connection to CSI driver, exiting

5. It seems like we are hitting:
- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1820737
but this bug is on ovn not sdn so it is strange.

6. Maybe it is also CSI related, but there are a lot of "ProvisioningFailed storageclass.storage.k8s.io * not found"

7. FailedMount MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "test-volume" : secret "secret-pod-ephm-test" not found (6 times)

We add similar problems in the past, asked on slack.

I asked on sdn slack

--- monitoring error 3
Hi all,
Hope I'm asking in the right place, We tried running conformance tests on ovirt and on the monitor cluster test I saw a lot of:
pod should not transition Running->Pending even when terminated
I saw a discuccion about it but couldn't find the bug
https://coreos.slack.com/archives/CK1AE4ZCK/p1575376807016100
are you familiar with that error ?

---- network error 5
Hi all,
We tried running conformance tests on ovirt and on the monitor cluster test I saw a lot of:
reason/FailedCreatePodSandBox Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to create pod network sandbox ..... : error adding container to network "openshift-sdn": delegateAdd: error invoking confAdd - "openshift-sdn": error in getting result from AddNetwork: CNI request failed with status 400: 'pods "pvc-tester-9d52q" not found\n'
I saw that we have this bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1820737 that is on ovn, we use SDN but see the same thing.
