One way to enable a user (someuser in the following example) to use sudo to become root
without a password is to install a file with the appropriate directives into the
/etc/sudoers.d directory (owned by root, with octal permissions 0400):

    ## password-less sudo for Ansible user
    someuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
