# Writing Loops and Conditional Tasks

## Task Iteration with Loops

Ansible supports iterating a task over a set of items using the **loop** keyword.
We will covers simple loops that iterate over a list of items.
Consult the documentation for more advanced looping scenarios [link](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_loops.html#complex-loops).

Simple Loops

A simple loop iterates a task over a list of items. The loop keyword is added to the task, and takes as a value the list of items over which the task should be iterated. The variable **item** holds the value used during each iteration.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Postfix and Dovecot are running
  service:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: started
  loop:
    - postfix
    - dovecot
```

Loops over a List of Hashes or Dictionaries

The loop list can be a dictionary, the value of each key in the current item loop variable can be retrieved with the item.key1 and item.key2 variables, respectively.

```yaml
- name: Users exist and are in the correct groups
  user:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    state: present
    groups: "{{ item.groups }}"
  loop:
    - name: jane
      groups: wheel
    - name: joe
      groups: root
The outcome of the preceding task is that the user jane is present and a member of the group wheel, and that the user joe is present and a member of the group root.
```

## Running Tasks Conditionally

Ansible can use conditionals to execute tasks or plays when certain conditions are met.
Playbook variables, registered variables, and Ansible facts can all be tested with conditionals. Operators to compare strings, numeric data, and Boolean values are available.

Conditional Task Syntax

The **when** statement is used to run a task conditionally.

```yaml
---
- name: Simple Boolean Task Demo
  hosts: all
  vars:
    run_my_task: true

  tasks:
    - name: httpd package is installed
      yum:
        name: httpd
      when: run_my_task
```

Example Conditionals:

```bash
Equal (value is a string)   |   ansible_machine == "x86_64"
Equal (value is numeric)    |   max_memory == 512
Numeric comparessions       |   < | > | <= | => | !=
Variable exists             |   min_memory is defined
Variable does not exist     |   min_memory is not defined
Boolean variable is true    |   memory_available
Boolean variable is false   |   not memory_available
element in linst            |	ansible_distribution in supported_distros
```

Multiple Conditions:

We can use **and, or, ()** to combine multiple conditions

```
- when: ansible_distribution == "RedHat" or ansible_distribution == "Fedora"
- when: ansible_distribution_version == "7.5" and ansible_kernel == "3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64"
- when:
  - ansible_distribution_version == "7.5"
  - ansible_kernel == "3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64"
- when: >
    ( ansible_distribution == "RedHat" and
      ansible_distribution_major_version == "7" )
    or
    ( ansible_distribution == "Fedora" and
    ansible_distribution_major_version == "28" )
```

** When you use when with loop for a task, the when statement is checked for each item
