# Ansible Handlers

Playbooks have a basic event system that can be used to respond to changes made by a playbook.
These ‘events’ are called ‘notify‘ in ansible and they are used to ‘notify‘ the playbook on certain actions. The events are triggered at the end of each block of tasks in a play, and will only be triggered once even if notified by multiple different tasks.

Each event or ‘notify‘ statment can have a handler to handle the event. Handlers are tasks that respond to a notification triggered by other tasks. Handlers can be considered as inactive tasks that only get triggered when explicitly invoked using a **notify statement**.

Some notes to keep in mind:

- Tasks only notify their handlers when the task changes something on a managed host.
- Use unique handler names. If you trigger more than one handler with the same name, the first one(s) get overwritten. Only the last one defined will run.
- Each handler is triggered at the **end of a block of tasks** in a playbook.
- If more than one task notifies a handler, the handler only runs once after all other tasks in the block have completed. If no tasks notify it, a handler will not run.
- A task may call more than one handler in its notify section.
- Handlers always run in the order specified by the handlers section of the play. They do not run in the order in which they are listed by notify statements in a task, or in the order in which tasks notify them.
- Handlers normally run after all other tasks in the play complete. A handler called by a task in the tasks part of the playbook will not run until all tasks under tasks have been processed. (There are some minor exceptions to this.)

Example:
how the Apache server is only restarted by the restart apache handler when a configuration file is updated and notifies it:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: copy demo.example.conf configuration template
    template:
      src: /var/lib/templates/demo.example.conf.template
      dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/demo.example.conf
    notify:
      - restart apache

handlers:
  - name: restart apache
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
```

**IMPORTANT**
Handlers are meant to perform an extra action when a task makes a change to a managed host. They should not be used as a replacement for normal tasks.

## Managing Task Errors in Plays

Ansible evaluates the return code of each task to determine whether the task succeeded or failed. Normally, when a task fails Ansible immediately aborts the rest of the play on that host, skipping all subsequent tasks.
However, sometimes you might want to have play execution continue even if a task fails.
There are a number of Ansible features that can be used to manage task errors:

- **Ignoring Task Failure:**
  We can ignore failed tasks with the **ignore_errors** keyword.
  
    ```yaml
    name: Latest version of notapkg is installed
    yum:
        name: notapkg
        state: latest
    ignore_errors: yes
    ```

- **Forcing Execution of Handlers after Task Failure:**
  
  Normally when a task fails and the play aborts on that host, any handlers that had been notified by earlier tasks in the play will not run. If you set **force_handlers: yes** on the play, then notified handlers are called even if the play aborted because a later task failed.

    ```yaml
    hosts: all
    force_handlers: yes
    tasks:
        - name: a task which always notifies its handler
        command: /bin/true
        notify: restart the database

        - name: a task which fails because the package doesn't exist
        yum:
            name: notapkg
            state: latest

    handlers:
        - name: restart the database
        service:
            name: mariadb
            state: restarted
    ```

- **Specifying Task Failure Conditions:**

    You can use the **failed_when** keyword on a task to specify which conditions indicate that the task has failed. This is often used with command modules that may successfully execute a command, but the command's output indicates a failure.

    ```yaml
    tasks:
    - name: Run user creation script
        shell: /usr/local/bin/create_users.sh
        register: command_result
        failed_when: "'Password missing' in command_result.stdout"
    ```

    The fail module can also be used to force a task failure. The above scenario can alternatively be written as two tasks:

    ```yaml
    tasks:
    - name: Run user creation script
        shell: /usr/local/bin/create_users.sh
        register: command_result
        ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Report script failure
        fail:
        msg: "The password is missing in the output"
        when: "'Password missing' in command_result.stdout"
    ```

    You can use the fail module to provide a clear failure message for the task. This approach also enables delayed failure, allowing you to run intermediate tasks to complete or roll back other changes.

- **Specifying When a Task Reports “Changed” Results:**

    The **changed_when** keyword can be used to control when a task reports that it has changed.

    ```yaml
    - name: get Kerberos credentials as "admin"
        shell: echo "{{ krb_admin_pass }}" | kinit -f admin
        changed_when: false
    # changed_when: false  == only reports ok or failed.
    ```

    ```yaml
    tasks:
    - shell:
        cmd: /usr/local/bin/upgrade-database
        register: command_result
        changed_when: "'Success' in command_result.stdout"
        notify:
        - restart_database

    handlers:
    - name: restart_database
        service:
        name: mariadb
        state: restarted
    ```

- **Ansible Blocks and Error Handling:**

    In playbooks, blocks can be used to control how tasks are executed.
    For example, a task block can have a when keyword to apply a conditional to multiple tasks:

    ```yaml
    - name: block example
    hosts: all
    tasks:
        - name: installing and configuring Yum versionlock plugin 
        block:
        - name: package needed by yum
            yum:
            name: yum-plugin-versionlock
            state: present
        - name: lock version of tzdata
            lineinfile:
            dest: /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/versionlock.list
            line: tzdata-2016j-1
            state: present
        when: ansible_distribution == "RedHat"
    ```

    Blocks also allow for error handling in combination with the **rescue** and **always** statements. If any task in a block fails, tasks in its rescue block are executed in order to recover.

    - block: Defines the main tasks to run.
    - rescue: Defines the tasks to run if the tasks defined in the block clause fail.
    - always: Defines the tasks that will always run independently of the success or failure of tasks defined in the block and rescue clauses.

    ```yaml
    tasks:
        - name: Upgrade DB
        block:
            - name: upgrade the database
            shell:
                cmd: /usr/local/lib/upgrade-database
        rescue:
            - name: revert the database upgrade
            shell:
                cmd: /usr/local/lib/revert-database
        always:
            - name: always restart the database
            service:
                name: mariadb
                state: restarted
    ```

    Note thhat the when condition on a block clause also applies to its rescue and always clauses if present.
