# Understanding Best Practices

## Directory Structure

You start with you project directory, for this section we will call it ~/my_project.
Under the project directory you should always have:

- ansible.cfg - containing project specific configurations.
- inventory files - multiple inventory files for specific purpose, for example inventory-dev and inventory-prod.
- variable directories:
  - group_vars - variables to particular groups.
  - host_vars - variables to particular systems.
  - vars(not recommended) - only if we really need variables that are used in multiple playbooks and doesn't fit group_vars\host_vars directories.
- playbooks:
  - site.yml - master playbook which will call all the other playbooks/roles.
  - webservers.yml, dbservers.yml and so on
