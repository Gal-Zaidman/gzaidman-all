# Ansible Variables

Ansible variables can be used to store values that can be reused in Ansible projects. This can simplify the creation and maintenance of a project and reduce the number of errors.
Variables provide a convenient way to manage dynamic values for a given environment.

## Syntax

There are a few constrains on a variable name:

- must start with a letter
- can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

Variables can be defined in many places but the main scopes are:

- Global scope - set from the command line or Ansible configuration.
- Play scope - set in the play and related structures.
- Host scope - set on host groups and individual hosts by the inventory, fact gathering, or registered tasks

## How to define variables

1. Playbook variables can be defined in multiple ways.

   - Vars block at the beginning of a **playbook**:
     
   ```yaml
       - hosts: all
       vars:
           user: joe
           home: /home/joe
   ```

   - variables in external files. the vars_files contains a list of names for external variable files relative to the location of the playbook:

   ```yaml
       # playbook:
           - hosts: all
           vars_files:
               - vars/users.yml

       # users.yml:
           user: joe
           home: /home/joe
   ```

2. We already saw how can we define host/group variables, but has a recap"

  - In the inventory:

```yaml
# Defining the ansible_user host variable for demo.example.com:
[servers]
demo.example.com  ansible_user=joe

# Defining the user group variable for the servers host group.
[servers]
demo1.example.com
demo2.example.com

[servers:vars]
user=joe

# Defining the user group variable for the servers group, which consists of two host groups each with two servers.
[servers1]
demo1.example.com
demo2.example.com

[servers2]
demo3.example.com
demo4.example.com

[servers:children]
servers1
servers2

[servers:vars]
user=joe
```

  2. In a directory called host_vars and group_vars:

```yaml
# cat ~/project/inventory
[datacenter1]
demo1.example.com
demo2.example.com

[datacenter2]
demo3.example.com
demo4.example.com

[datacenters:children]
datacenter1
datacenter2

# cat ~/project/group_vars/datacenters
package: httpd

# cat ~/project/group_vars/datacenter1
package: httpd

# ~/project/group_vars/datacenter2
package: apache

# cat ~/project/host_vars/demo1.example.com
package: httpd
# cat ~/project/host_vars/demo2.example.com
package: apache
# cat ~/project/host_vars/demo3.example.com
package: mariadb-server
# cat ~/project/host_vars/demo4.example.com
package: mysql-server

# The directory structure for the example
project
├── ansible.cfg
├── group_vars
│   ├── datacenters
│   ├── datacenters1
│   └── datacenters2
├── host_vars
│   ├── demo1.example.com
│   ├── demo2.example.com
│   ├── demo3.example.com
│   └── demo4.example.com
├── inventory
└── playbook.yml
```

- Extra variables - variables set on the command line
  
```yaml
    ansible-playbook main.yml -e "package=apache"
```

## Usage

To use the variable in a task we wrap it with curly braces {{ }}, for example:

```yaml
    tasks:
    # This line will read: Creates the user joe
    - name: Creates the user {{ user }}
        user:
        # This line will create the user named Joe
        name: "{{ user }}"
```

quotes are mandatory when a variable is used as the first element to start a value

- Host and group variables - There are two ways of defaining host/group vars

## Variables arrays

```yaml
users:
  bjones:
    first_name: Bob
    last_name: Jones
    home_dir: /users/bjones
  acook:
    first_name: Anne
    last_name: Cook
    home_dir: /users/acook
```

You can then use the following variables to access user data:

```bash
users.bjones.first_name # Returns 'Bob'

users['bjones']['first_name'] # Returns 'Bob'
```

## How to save output to a variable

The register statement captures the output of a command. The output is saved into a temporary variable that can be used later in the playbook.

Example:

```yaml
---
- name: Installs a package and prints the result
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install the package
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: installed
      register: install_result

    - debug: var=install_result

# Note: When you run the playbook, the debug module is used to dump the value of the install_result registered variable to the terminal.

[user@demo ~]$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml
PLAY [Installs a package and prints the result] ****************************

TASK [setup] ***************************************************************
ok: [demo.example.com]

TASK [Install the package] *************************************************
ok: [demo.example.com]

TASK [debug] ***************************************************************
ok: [demo.example.com] => {
    "install_result": {
        "changed": false,
        "msg": "",
        "rc": 0,
        "results": [
            "httpd-2.4.6-40.el7.x86_64 providing httpd is already installed"
        ]
    }
}

PLAY RECAP *****************************************************************
demo.example.com    : ok=3    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

## Variables precedence

From least to greatest (the last listed variables winning prioritization):

1. command line values (eg “-u user”)
2. role defaults [1]
3. inventory file or script group vars [2]
4. inventory group_vars/all [3]
5. playbook group_vars/all [3]
6. inventory group_vars/* [3]
7. playbook group_vars/* [3]
8. inventory file or script host vars [2]
9. inventory host_vars/* [3]
10. playbook host_vars/* [3]
11. host facts / cached set_facts [4]
12. play vars
13. play vars_prompt
14. play vars_files
15. role vars (defined in role/vars/main.yml)
16. block vars (only for tasks in block)
17. task vars (only for the task)
18. include_vars
19. set_facts / registered vars
20. role (and include_role) params
21. include params
22. extra vars (always win precedence)
