## Defining Software Architecture

Software Architecture is the combination of structure of the system, architecture characteristics the system must support, architecture decisions, and finally design principles.
**Structure of the system** refers to the type of architecture style (or styles) the system is implemented in (such as microservices, layered, or microkernel).
**Architecture characteristics** (such as availability, Reliability, Scalability and so on) define the success criteria of a system, which is generally orthogonal to the functionality of the system, they are also refered to as non functional requirements, since they don't require knowledge of the functionality of the system, yet they are required in order for the system to function properly.
**Architecture decisions** define the rules for how a system should be constructed.
For example, an architect might make an architecture decision that only the business and services layers within a layered architecture can access the database.
**Design principle** differs from an architecture decision in that a design principle is a guideline rather than a hard-and-fast rule. For example, "development teams should leverage asynchronous messaging between services within a microservices architecture to increase performance"

## Laws of Software Architecture

"Everything in software architecture is a trade-off." - First Law of Software Architecture

"If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn’t a trade-off, more likely they just haven’t identified the trade-off yet."

"Why is more important than how."
