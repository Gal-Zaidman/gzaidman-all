# What contains a Kubernetes Cluster

## etcd

etcd is a distributed and reliable key-value store Database that is Simple, Secure and Fast.
Unlike SQL which saves a table for multiple entities, a row for each entity, and a col for each member of that entity.
A key-value database is a database that save each entity in its own "page", and maps each member of that entity to its value. That way adding a member to one entity doesn't effect other entities.
In Kubernetes etcd stores information about the cluster state and the elements in it like, Pods, Nodes, Configs, Secrets, Accounts and so on, all the information you see when you run kubectl get... is retrieved from the etcd, each operation that you preform counts as done only after it is registered in etcd.

To communicate with etcd db directly we can use the default CLI client etcdctl.

We can setup etcd in kubernetes in 2 ways:

- Manual: This is the hard way in which we need to configure the etcd service.
- Kubeadm etcd will run in a container and we can comunicate with it through kubectl, like:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec etcd-master –n kube-system etcdctl get / --prefix –keys-only.
    ```

## Kubeapi

Kubeapi is the primary control unit of the cluster, whenever we issue a kubectl command, the kubectl talks to the kube-apiserver.
Kubeapi server is responsible for user authentication, validation and interacting with the ETCD.

## Kube Controller Manager

The kube controller is a process who continuously watch the system and takes actions to remediate the situation when thing go wrong.
There are many different controllers in a kubernetes cluster such as:

- Node controller - which is in charge of monitoring the state of the Nodes in the system.
- Replication controller - who is in charge of the replica sets in the system, when it identifies that a pod went down he will bring him up.

There are many more controllers, basically every resource has its controller that knows how to manage that specific resource and all of them are a part of the kube controller manager.

## Kube Scheduler 

The scheduler in kubernetes has a similar role has the scheduler in our OS.
He decides where a component will be deployed(on which node) and when.
Notice that he is not the one who places the component, that is the kubelet job.

When a pod needs to be deployed the scheduler looks at all the nodes in the system and filters the ones that don't have sufficient resources for running the pod, ranks the reminding nodes and choose the highest ranked node, the scheduler uses a ranking function to rank each one of the nodes.
we can write our own schedulers and there are a few available.

## Kubelet

Kubelet is a service that runs on all the worker nodes and acts has the contact point with the node.
Kubelet talks to the kube-apiserver within the masters nodes, and he is responsible for:

- Registering the node into the cluster. 
- Create/Update/Remove pods when instructed buy the scheduler (scheduler -> kube-apiserver -> kubelet -> container engine running in the node) 
- Monitor Node and Pods.

Kubelet has to be installed manually, when we setup a cluster with kubeadm we still need to install kubelet on the worker nodes.

## Kube-Proxy

It is required that within the cluster all pods would be able to communicate with each other.
That communication is achieved by using a networking solution which connects all the pods, there are a few networks available (OVN, SDN).
In Kubernetes a pod IP address can always change, so pods don't communicate with each other directly, they use services for communication.
A service is not a regular kubernetes component, it is not a physical entity which runs as a container/process, it is a virtual entity that leaves inside kubernetes memory.
To enable pods to communicate with services we have the kube-proxy.
Kube-proxy runs as a process on each pod and looks for available services and creates the iptable rules to forward traffic from the services to the pods.
