# Logging & Monitoring

## Monitor Cluster Components

### How metrics are gathered

The kubelet contains a subcomponent known as as cAdvisor or Container Advisor.
cAdvisor is responsible for retrieving performance metrics from pods, and exposing them through the kubelet API to make them available for the Metrics Server.

### View performance metrics

To view performance metrics we use the `kubectl top RESOURCE` command, for example:

```
kubectl top node
NAME                           CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
ovirt10-8tt99-master-0         1845m        24%    6671Mi          45%
ovirt10-8tt99-master-1         1824m        24%    6043Mi          41%
ovirt10-8tt99-master-2         1265m        16%    5698Mi          39%
ovirt10-8tt99-worker-0-89fhr   1871m        24%    6156Mi          42%
ovirt10-8tt99-worker-0-gljhc   774m         10%    3328Mi          22%
