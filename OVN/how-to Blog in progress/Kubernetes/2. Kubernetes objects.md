# Kubernetes Objects:

## Pods

A Pod is the smallest unit that we can create in kubernetes, and often called the building block of kubernetes. A pod contains one or more containers.
When creating a pod we need to make sure that the application that will run in it is already packaged as a container and available on some container registry such as docker hub or quay.
Because a pod is the smallest manageble unit all the containers within that pod will be created on the same Node and will have the same network space, so they can communicate with each other has local host.

**Helpful commands:**

```bash
# See all running pods:
kubectl get pods -A

# See Pods on a specific namespace
kubectl get pods -n NAMESPACE

# Get all information on a specific pod
kubectl describe POD -n NAMESPACE

# Create a pod yaml definition file
kubectl run NAME --image=IMAGE:TAG --dry-run -o yaml > FILE_NAME.yaml

# Create a single pod from image
kubectl run NAME --image=IMAGE:TAG

# Manually Scale a pod
kubectl scale --replicas=X pod POD_NAME
```

## Replication Set (Controller)

Replica Sets ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. Replica Sets replaced Replication Controllers, there are minor differences between them but they have the same purpose.
They provide:

- High Availability – we use replication controller to get HA of our environment, a replication controller can make sure that if a pod dies another one will be spawn, or to replicate the pod so there will be multiple instances of it on the cluster.
- Load Balancing and scaling – The replication controller can spawn new replicas in case we need to scale and load balance between them.

When we define a Replica Set we need to specify 3 important fields under the spec section.

- template: a pod defenitaion that will be used to create new pods for the set to manage.
- replicas: the amount of replicas that will be managed by the set.
- selector: Used to select other pods that are available in the cluster. If the selector finds pods that match, the replica set will take them under his management. For example if we set the replicas section to 3 and there are 3 pods found that match the selector, then the replica set will not spawn another pod (from the template definition).

replicasets are apiVersion: apps/v1

**Helpful commands:**

```bash
# Scale the replica set
kubectl scale --replicas=X replicaset RS_NAME

# Update the replica set
kubectl edit  replicaset RS_NAME
kubectl replace -f replicaset.yaml
```

## Deployment

A Deployment is a Kubernetes object which contains and extends the ReplicaSet. When we create a deployment then a replica set is automatically created for managing the pods defined in the deployment. The deployment adds the functionality of a rolling updates/upgrades and transactions to the replica set.
When we use kubernetes we mainly work with deployments.

![Alt text](images/deployment-replicaset.png?raw=true)

```bash
# Create a deployment definition file
kubectl run NAME --image=IMAGE:TAG --generator=deployment --dry-run -o yaml > FILE_NAME.yaml

# create deployment
kubectl create deployment NAME --image=IMAGE:TAG

# Update the deployment
kubectl edit  deployment/RS_NAME
kubectl replace -f deployment.yaml
```

## Namespace 

A Namespace is a Kubernetes object which provide isolation in our cluster. Lets think of the following analogy, we have 2 people named Gal, we can distinguish them by using their family name, Gal Zaidman and Gal ben-Yakov if we will look at their houses then people inside Gal Zaidman house will refer to Gal Zaidman as Gal, but to Gal ben-Yakov as Gal ben-Yakov.
We can think of a namespace as a house each house has its own resources and rules, all the people inside the house refer to one another on their first name.

By default kubernetes sets up the default, kube-system and kube-public namesaces and we can create more as we need to.

Object from deferent namespaces can interact with each other but we have to use the full name, example: 

- Same namespace: "db-service"
- Different namespace: "db-service.<namespace>.<type of object>.<domain name of cluster>

We can limit the resources available in a namespace by creating a resourceQuota object with the namespace name in the metadata section.

## Services

Services allow us to expose pods to the outside world and to each other, they enable decoupling between different microservices.

There are different types of services:

- ClusterIP: The most basic service which is used for inner cluster communication. The service will get a virtual IP address(VIP) from the cluster to enable communication between different services inside the cluster.
  When we use ClusterIP 2 ports are defined:

  - TargetPort: the port on the pod.
  - Port: the port on the service.

  ```bash
  #Creating a service
  kubectl expose pod NAME --port=80 --target-port=80 --name SERVICE_NAME
  # Creating a service yaml
  kubectl expose pod NAME --port=80 --target-port=80 --name SERVICE_NAME --dry-run -o yaml
  ```

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: my-app
    labels:
      run: my-app
  spec:
    type: ClusterIP
    ports:
    - targetPort: 80
      port: 80
      protocol: TCP
    selector:
      run: my-app
  ```

- Nodeport: Service which listens to a port on the node and forward requests to the port on the pod.
  When we use NodePort 3 ports are defined:

  - TargetPort: the port on the pod.
  - Port: the port on the service.
  - NodePort: A port on the node which the service listens to.

  The service will get a virtual IP address(VIP) from the cluster, which we will use to reach a certain pod that the service exposes.
  When we create the service we must specify a selector to select the pods that the service will expose.
  When we have multiple pods the service acts as a LoadBalancer between them.
  When we have multiple pods on multiple nodes, if we don't specify on the configuration, kubernetes will automatically expose the NodePort on all the nodes.

  The yaml file is very similar, we just need to add the type and the nodePort

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: my-app
    labels:
      run: my-app
  spec:
    type: NodePort
    ports:
    - targetPort: 80
      port: 80
      nodePort: 30007
      protocol: TCP
    selector:
      run: my-app
  ```

- Loadbalancing:
